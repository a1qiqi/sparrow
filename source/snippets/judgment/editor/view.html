                    <p placeholder="首部" id="accuser">Each human being is born as something new, something that never existed before. Each is born with the
                      capacity to win at life. Each person has a unique way of seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and thinking.
                      Each has his or her own unique potentials---capabilities and limitations. Each can be a significant,
                      thinking, aware, and creative being---a productive person, a winner.</p>
                    <p placeholder="首部" id="accuserAgent">The word “winner” and “loser” have many meanings. When we refer to a person as a winner, we do not mean
                      one who makes someone else lose. To us, a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible,
                      trustworthy, responsive, and genuine, both as an individual and as a member of a society.</p>
                    <p placeholder="首部" id="defendant">Winners do not dedicated their lives to a concept of what they imagine they should be; rather, they are
                      themselves and as such do not use their energy putting on a performance, maintaining pretence and manipulating
                      others. They are aware that there is a difference between being loving and acting loving, between being
                      stupid and acting stupid, between being knowledgeable and acting knowledgeable. Winners do not need
                      to hide behind a mask.</p>
                    <p placeholder="首部" id="defendantAgent">Winners are not afraid to do their own thinking and to use their own knowledge. They can separate facts
                      from opinions and don’t pretend to have all the answers. They listen to others, evaluate what they
                      say, but come to their own conclusions. Although winners can admire and respect other people, they
                      are not totally defined, demolished, bound, or awed by them.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div id="judgment-bottom">
                    <p placeholder="首部" id="caseGeneral">Winners do not play “helpless”, nor do they play the blaming game. Instead, they assume responsibility
                      for their own lives. They don’t give others a false authority over them. Winners are their own bosses
                      and know it.</p>
                    <p placeholder="事实" id="claims">A winner’s timing is right. Winners respond appropriately to the situation. Their responses are related
                      to the message sent and preserve the significance, worth, well-being, and dignity of the people involved.
                      Winners know that for everything there is a season and for every activity a time.</p>
                    <p placeholder="事实" id="argued">Although winners can freely enjoy themselves, they can also postpone enjoyment, can discipline themselves
                      in the present to enhance their enjoyment in the future. Winners are not afraid to go after what he
                      wants, but they do so in proper ways. Winners do not get their security by controlling others. They
                      do not set themselves up to lose.</p>
                    <p placeholder="事实" id="factResult">A winner cares about the world and its peoples. A winner is not isolated from the general problems of
                      society, but is concerned, compassionate, and committed to improving the quality of life. Even in the
                      face of national and international adversity, a winner’s self-image is not one of a powerless individual.
                      A winner works to make the world a better place.</p>
